        Hey, I'm Joseph. I'm a software engineer who has a passion for building and helping teams create engaging
        software. My interest in programming began in 2013 when I was asked to build a website for a former employer. As
        I pored over material to learn HTML & CSS, I realized that being a self-taught developer was completely within
        my grasp, and what I wanted to pursue as a career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to today and I've had the privilege to work as a software engineer in test at two early-stage
        companies, where I've learned not only how to properly test software, but also how to build test frameworks from
        scratch, writing clean, maintainable and reusable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not programming, I enjoy spending time with my family in the mountains snowboarding, hiking, and
        camping.
      </p>
